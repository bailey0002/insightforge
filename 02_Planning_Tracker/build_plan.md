Notes

Progress: Directory on SSD, Notion/VS Code installed, Trello pending, CLT/Xcode 26.0 updated, venv clean (fastapi, uvicorn), Homebrew clean, GitHub repo live (bailey0002/insightforge, pruned).
Tool Setup: Notion for docs, Trello (web) for tasks, GitHub for code/artifacts, VS Code for editing, Terminal for commands.
venv Isolation: source .venv/bin/activate, Conda base disabled to avoid conflicts with ConfiDoc/Sonique.
Risks: None currentlyâ€”repo cleaned, Homebrew fixed.
Next Actions:
Set up Trello board, import JSON.
Start Next.js setup.
Draft insightforge_specs.md.
Sync artifacts to Notion.
