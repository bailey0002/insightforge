Notes

Tool Setup: Use Notion for docs, Trello for tasks, GitHub for code/artifacts. VS Code for editing, Terminal for commands.
venv Isolation: Always activate .venv (source .venv/bin/activate) to avoid conflicts with other projects (e.g., ConfiDoc, Sonique).
Grok Support: Prompt for code (e.g., X API integration), debugging, or artifact updates.
Risks:
Learning curve: Mitigated by Grokâ€™s step-by-step commands.
Dependency conflicts: Use .venv and check pip list before installs.
Homebrew issues: Resolved (CLT/Xcode updated per Sep 29).



Next Steps

Sep 29: Import Trello JSON, paste Charter into Notion.
Sep 30: Run GitHub CLI setup (gh auth login), push repo.
Oct 1: Initialize Next.js (npx create-next-app src/frontend).
